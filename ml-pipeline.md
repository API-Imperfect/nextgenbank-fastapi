# Limitations of Rule-Based AI in Fraud Detection

Rule-based AI systems, while initially effective, come with several limitations when applied to fraud detection:

- **Limited Adaptability**  
  Rule-based systems cannot automatically adjust to new fraud patterns without manual intervention.

- **Lack of Personalization**  
  The same rules are applied to all customers, ignoring individual behavioral differences.

- **Maintenance Burden**  
  Constant manual updates are required as fraud tactics evolve.

- **Scalability Issues**  
  As new fraud scenarios emerge, rule complexity grows exponentially, making the system harder to manage.

- **Handling Complex Relationships**  
  Our rule based implementation is limited to simple `if-then` logic and will thus struggle with interactions between multiple variables.

- **Limited Context Awareness**  
  Rule-based implementations struggle to incorporate user history and behavioral patterns that machine learning models handle more naturally.

# Moving Beyond Rules: Introducing Gradient Boosting

To overcome these limitations, we are enhancing our fraud detection system by integrating **machine learning**, specifically the **Gradient Boosting** model.

Gradient Boosting is highly effective for fraud detection in financial transactions for the following reasons:

1. **Effective on Imbalanced Data**  
   It performs well even when fraud accounts for less than 1% of transactions.

2. **Feature Importance Metrics**  
   The model highlights which transaction attributes are most predictive of fraud.

3. **Recognition of Nonlinear Patterns**  
   By using an ensemble of decision trees, it captures complex interactions between variables.

4. **Optimized for Structured Data**  
   It works exceptionally well on structured data such as transaction records (amounts, timestamps, account IDs, etc.).

5. **Robust Against Outliers**  
   Fraudulent transactions often appear as statistical anomalies, and Gradient Boosting handles these effectively.

By adopting Gradient Boosting, we aim to significantly enhance our fraud detection capabilities with a more adaptive, scalable, and context-aware approach.
