# Understanding Gradient Boosting: A Simple Explanation

The **Gradient Boosting** model can be thought of as a **team of specialists**, each working together to improve the final result. Every model in the sequence learns from the mistakes of its predecessors.

## How Gradient Boosting Works

1. **Start with a Simple Model**  
   The process begins with a basic model — usually a single decision tree — that makes initial predictions. These predictions will often have many errors.

2. **Correct the Errors**  
   A second model is trained specifically to correct the mistakes made by the first model.

3. **Refine Further**  
   A third model is added, this time to correct the remaining errors that the first two models together couldn’t solve.

4. **Iterative Improvement**  
   This continues for many iterations. Each new model is focused on the residual errors left by all the previous models.

5. **Final Prediction**  
   All models are combined to produce the final prediction. Each one contributes a small part, and together they form a much more accurate result.

In short, Gradient Boosting is a **powerful technique** where **each model learns from past mistakes**, leading to **increasingly better performance over time**.
